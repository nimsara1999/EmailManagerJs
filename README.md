## Email Manager



The project is an email management system that allows users to communicate with each other and receive notifications. The system has two types of users: admin and normal. The admin user can manage the system settings, such as adding or deleting users, assigning roles, and configuring the notification system. The normal user can send and receive emails, view their inbox, and manage their personal settings.

The system has a dynamic dashboard that changes according to the user’s role and preferences. The dashboard displays the user’s name, email address, role, and a menu of options. The options include:

-   Inbox: This shows the list of emails received by the user, with the sender’s name, subject, date, and status (read or unread). The user can open an email to read its content, reply to it, forward it, delete it, or mark it as unread.
-   Compose: This allows the user to create a new email and send it to one or more recipients. The user can enter the recipient’s email address, subject, and message. 
-   Sent: This shows the list of emails sent by the user, with the recipient’s name, subject, date, and status (delivered or undelivered). The user can open an email to view its content, resend it, forward it, delete it, or edit it.
-   Settings: This allows the user to change their personal settings, such as account password.

The system also has a birthday notification system that sends an email to the user on their birthday.  Also it shows in other user's dashboard.
